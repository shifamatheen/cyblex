1. Abstract

2. Requirements Analysis and Specification
The development process for a user-friendly Real-Time Legal Advisory System required a complete analysis of requirements. System requirements development established a solid foundation for architecture design by determining expectations and addressing challenges as well as specifying preferences of end users together with legal advisors and administrators. The project team obtained information through qualitative and quantitative research methods to achieve technical feasibility alongside user satisfaction. Real-life legal service needs developed into operational guidelines that enabled the creation of an accessible scalable digital solution during this phase.

2.1 Approach to Requirements Gathering
The development of the Real-Time Legal Advisory System used an organized multi-strategy to comprehend requirements from different stakeholders who deliver legal services and access them. Multiple empirical research strategies served the project team instead of theoretical models or assumptions to drive their work. The collection of these strategies exposed functional difficulties along with typical user behaviors and system requirements which directly influenced how the system would operate and behave for its users. The following techniques were employed:

2.1.1 Interviews with Potential Users and Legal Professionals
To gain a comprehensive understanding of ground-level needs and pain points, multiple interviews were conducted with individuals both within and outside the formal legal advisory process. This included law students and lecturers from General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University. Informal discussions were also held with small business owners, professionals in the education sector, and individuals encountered in various settings.

Semi-structured interviews enabled open-ended discussions to answer the following essential themes:
People expressed a strong preference for various legal communication methods which combined telephone calls, chat options and personal meetings. The respondents selected chat communication more frequently than phone conversations.
Users reported they need quick and simple options to secure immediate legal help because they struggle with prompt legal service availability.
The main concerns involved privacy issues while trust became another significant issue.
Different functionalities for an online legal solution were suggested by the user community. Legal professionals sought out a system that would boost operational efficiency and simplify business procedures.

This method allowed the collection of qualitative, context-specific data that revealed unmet needs and practical expectations. Both professionals and non-professionals came together in this study because it provided a comprehensive perspective on legal advisory service requirements and capabilities.

2.1.2 Online Surveys
Potential respondents accessed the Google Form to complete the online survey. The survey addressed participants from different parts of the nation and various occupational groups. The questionnaire consisted of both multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions.

Key areas of investigation included:
Frequency of legal service use
Barriers to accessing legal help
Users prefer online platforms that offer multilingual support together with advisor review features and live chat functionality.

The quantitative approach made it possible to study common patterns and user profiles together with statistical user preferences as the foundation for essential platform requirements and essential feature selection.

The full survey questionnaire and response analysis are included in 8.1 Appendix A.1 – Online Survey Form and Results.

2.1.3 Observation of Existing Manual Processes
Data gathered through observation took place at the Law Students' Association of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka National Arbitration Centre while public legal consultation events were monitored as well. An observation study was conducted to watch traditional legal consultations without interrupting the process.

Key observations included:
The method used by clients when expressing their law-related problems
Advisors applied several methods to handle and organize various client inquiries before choosing their order of response.
The period of high client volume creates problems for managing time efficiently
Several approaches were used to record both advised solutions and follow-up tasks.

The research revealed operational flaws in present advisory procedures that enabled the development team to pinpoint technology areas for service enhancement by implementing category systems along with quicker service and documented processes.

2.1.4 Reviewing Existing Online Platforms
An analysis reviewed the features of LawRato with Avvo and JustAnswer and their user interface and user experience designs. The evaluation encompassed examinations of their design features together with UI/UX design patterns and user test results and their procedures for different legal domain areas.

The evaluation criteria included:
Accessibility (login requirements, regional language support)
Communication methods (chat, email, voice, video)
Monetization models (free vs paid consultation)
Legal coverage (jurisdiction, law types)
Trust elements (advisor verification, rating systems)

The review examination revealed three main gaps which included the absence of real-time communication functions and limited South Asian user localizations alongside Western countries' affordability constraints. Design choices and innovation strategies for the proposed system were developed using these obtained insights.

Summary of Approach
A diverse research approach which included interviews together with surveys and observations delivered complete information to understand users' requirements and system requirements. This method proved suitable because it enabled both immediate communication with the primary audience and revealed additional user perspectives. Real-world challenges emerged from observation activities which complemented platform reviews that provided understanding of technological feasibility and innovation capabilities.

Hosting Limitations: Due to budget constraints, initial deployment will be on a shared hosting platform with scalability options considered for future deployment.

2.7 Technology and Tools Justification
The selection of technologies for the Real-Time Legal Advisory System was based on four key factors: familiarity, application suitability, hosting compatibility, and community support. Below is a breakdown of the selected tools and the justification behind their use.

2.7.1 Backend: Python, PHP
Python was chosen for its simplicity, readability, and widespread use in developing secure APIs and backend logic (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009). PHP, on the other hand, is ideal for quick server-side scripting and offers native support across most shared hosting platforms, making it cost-effective and efficient (Welling & Thomson, 2009).

2.7.2 Frontend: Bootstrap
Bootstrap was selected for its powerful CSS framework that enables responsive, mobile-first designs with minimal effort. Its component-driven architecture allows developers to build professional interfaces rapidly, which is essential for user experience in legal advisory systems (Spurlock, 2013).

2.7.3 Database: MySQL

2.7.4 APIs: Payment Gateway API, Authentication API
The Payment Gateway API enables secure online payments for premium services, while the Authentication API helps manage user logins and roles securely. These APIs reduce the burden of creating these features from scratch and ensure professional-level security and reliability (Fielding, 2000).

All selected technologies are well-documented, widely supported, and offer a low learning curve, making them suitable even within the limited development timeframe.

Figure 2.7 visually represents the core technologies and tools used in the Real-Time Legal Advisory System.

2.8 Initial Work Schedule / Timeline

Figure 2.8 below illustrates the detailed work schedule of the project, outlining the sequence of tasks, their respective timeframes, and the allocation of responsibilities across various phases of the project lifecycle.

3. Design
This section covers the design plan of the proposed system, Cyblex, a real-time legal advising platform accessible via www.cyblex.com.The system name Cyblex was formed through the combination of "Cyber" and "Lex" which means "law" in Latin because its main reason exists to provide digital immediate legal guidance through secure intelligent platforms. Cyblex works to transform conventional legal consultation by developing a modern interface that helps both clients and professional legal experts to communicate instantly. The design process converts system needs into specific architectural elements which include use cases and database frameworks alongside UI screens and interactive components to direct the subsequent implementation stage.

According to Sommerville (2016), the design stage is critical in defining the system's structure and behaviors before coding begins, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and coherence across modules.Cyblex's design follows this guidance, with a layered architecture that prioritises flexibility and separation of concerns to enable a robust and scalable development process.

3.1 Architectural Design
The Real-Time Legal Advisory System is structured using a client-server architecture that ensures scalability, modularity, and maintainability. This architecture separates the system into three key layers: the presentation layer, the application logic layer, and the data layer. This design facilitates real-time communication between clients and legal professionals, while ensuring security, performance, and efficient system management.

3.1.1 System Layers and Technology Mapping
Presentation Layer
This layer is responsible for user interaction. It is implemented using Bootstrap, which offers responsive, mobile-friendly design capabilities. The interface will be accessible via web browsers and will cater to two primary user groups: clients and legal professionals. Key components include login forms, chat interfaces, consultation request modules, and payment forms.

Application Logic Layer
The business logic of the system resides here. It is developed using Python and PHP.

Python will handle the real-time aspects of the system such as dynamic consultations, data handling, and logical workflows.

PHP will be used for backend processing tasks including API handling and server-side form submissions.
This layer also manages secure authentication and integrates with third-party services such as payment processors.

Data Layer
The system uses a MySQL relational database to manage all persistent data including user profiles, chat history, expert reviews, transactions, and authentication records. The data schema is normalized for consistency and optimized for scalability and performance.

3.1.2 Third-Party Integrations
Authentication API will ensure secure user verification using standard encryption practices.

Payment Gateway API will facilitate real-time, secure monetary transactions between clients and legal professionals.

Figure 3.1.2 shows the interaction between the frontend (Bootstrap), backend logic (Python/PHP), database (MySQL), and external services (Authentication and Payment APIs), clearly labeling each component and how data flows through the system.

3.2 System Flow / Component Design
The Cyblex platform was designed on a modular client-server architecture, with main components interacting to provide real-time legal consulting services. The system is structured into three core subsystems: the User Interface Module, the Application Logic Module, and the Data Management Module, which all include connections with third-party services such as authentication APIs and payment gateways.

Figure 3.2 shows the high-level component diagram illustrating the interaction between these core modules and external services.

3.2.1 User Interface Module
This module, created using Bootstrap, offers an easy, multilingual frontend for three user types: clients, legal advisors, and administrators. It has features including login/signup, structured legal inquiry forms, live chat windows, advisor ratings, and dashboard views. The mobile-first strategy and responsive style ensure that users may engage with the system seamlessly across all devices (Spurlock, 2013).

3.2.2 Application Logic Module
Implemented using Python and PHP, this layer manages business logic. Python is responsible for real-time messaging and workflow handling, while PHP manages server-side processing, API communication, and form submissions. Python and PHP were chosen for their simplicity, extensive hosting compatibility, and strong community support (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009; Welling & Thomson, 2009).

3.2.3 Data Management Module
A MySQL relational database supports the storage and retrieval of user profiles, legal queries, chat records, advisor data, ratings, and payment logs. The database structure is normalized for consistency and optimized for scalability and performance (Welling & Thomson, 2009).

3.2.4 Third-Party Integration
This layer connects the backend with secure external services. The Authentication API enables encrypted login verification, and the Payment Gateway API ensures secure transaction processing in real time (Fielding, 2000).

These subsystems interact seamlessly to deliver a secure, efficient, and scalable legal advisory experience. The layered architecture follows best practices in system design, promoting maintainability and modularity, which are essential for long-term platform evolution and feature expansion (Sommerville, 2016).

3.3 UI Design / Wireframes
The user interface was designed to be minimal and responsive, ensuring a clean and clear user experience for all three primary user roles: clients, legal advisors, and administrators. The focus was on simplicity, clarity, and mobile responsiveness, enabling users to easily access legal services from any device.

3.3.1 Login Screen

As shown in Figure 3.3.1, the Login Screen features clearly labeled input fields, a "Remember Me" checkbox, and quick access buttons for password recovery and language selection. The UI supports three languages—Sinhala, Tamil, and English—with a language selector positioned for easy access.

3.3.2 Client Dashboard

Figure 3.3.2 shows the Client Dashboard, which presents a real-time chat panel on the right and a query submission form on the left. The user can submit structured legal questions, view previous chats, and rate advisor responses. This layout is implemented using Bootstrap for responsiveness and flexible layout grids (Spurlock, 2013).

3.3.3 Advisor Dashboard

Figure 3.3.3 shows the Advisor Dashboard, which includes a list of assigned queries, live chat notifications, and saved template responses. Advisors can accept or decline consultations and track their activity information.

3.3.4 Admin Panel
In Figure 3.3.4, the Admin Panel includes user management, advisor verification, and platform moderation tools. Tabs are used to navigate between user lists, analytics dashboards, and reported content queues. Color-coded status tags help admins quickly identify pending verifications or flagged queries.

The layout uses Bootstrap components for grid responsiveness and Figma for early prototyping. The wireframes follow a minimalist black-and-white design, using shades of grey and black to differentiate input fields, text labels, and UI elements. This monochrome style ensures clarity during early design stages and avoids distraction from functional layout evaluation. UI elements like buttons, forms, and icons were structured with high contrast and alignment to WCAG accessibility standards, focusing on legibility, spacing, and intuitive navigation. Color enhancements, such as blue and green for action cues (e.g., "Start Chat," "Verify Advisor"), were reserved for the final implementation phase.

Accessibility was prioritized through high-contrast text, large buttons and keyboard navigability (Sommerville, 2016).

These wireframes collectively reflect a platform tailored for legal service delivery that is secure, efficient, and accessible across all devices and user types.

3.4 Database Design
The Cyblex platform uses a structured and normalized relational database to manage critical data such as user profiles, legal queries, advisor responses, real-time messages, ratings, and transactions. The database design ensures data integrity, scalability, and efficient query handling across various modules.

3.4.1 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Figure 3.4.1 shows the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), which highlights the key entities in the system and their relationships. The primary entities include Users, LegalQueries, Messages, Advisors, Ratings, Transactions, and Admins. The ER diagram visually demonstrates how each table connects, using one-to-many relationships to enforce referential integrity. For example:
A one-to-many relationship exists between Users and LegalQueries, where a single user can submit multiple legal queries.

A one-to-many relationship also exists between LegalQueries and Messages, enabling multiple chat messages per query.

The Advisors table links to the Users table, allowing the system to distinguish verified legal professionals from general users.

3.4.2 Table Structure

Figure 3.4.2 presents the table structure, listing the fields for each table along with primary keys and foreign keys. For instance:
The Users table includes fields such as user_id, name, email, password, role, and preferred_language.

The LegalQueries table stores query_id, user_id, advisor_id, and category, while referencing both the Users and Advisors tables.

The Messages table captures the flow of conversation with fields like sender_id, receiver_id, timestamp, and content.

Normalization up to Third Normal Form (3NF) was applied to eliminate redundancy and ensure efficient updates. Lookup tables are used where applicable (e.g., for roles, languages), and the structure is designed for scalability and security (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009; Sommerville, 2016).

These figures show an effective and efficient schema that can consistently handle Cyblex's real-time advisory operations reliably.

3.5 Security Design
The Cyblex platform prioritizes user confidentiality and data integrity through strict security measures integrated across the system architecture. The system uses hashed passwords for authentication, utilizing bcrypt hashing to securely store credentials and protect against brute-force attacks (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009).

All users must log in through a secure authentication process, and role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users—clients, legal advisors, or administrators—can access their respective dashboards and features (Sommerville, 2016). For example, only verified advisors can respond to legal queries, and only admins can verify advisor profiles or manage users.

Session handling is managed securely through unique session tokens and automatic session timeouts to prevent unauthorized access from idle sessions. Cookies are flagged as HTTPOnly and Secure to guard against XSS and session hijacking.

Security features also include enforced HTTPS encryption for all data transactions, protecting client-advisor communication and payment-related information (Fielding, 2000). Additionally, backend validation is implemented on all input fields to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Figure 3.5 shows the security design implemented within the Cyblex platform. It depicts key mechanisms such as login authentication, role-based access control, hashed password storage, session timeout enforcement, secure cookie handling (HTTPOnly), and HTTPS encryption. These components work together to ensure that user data and communication remain secure and confidential throughout system usage.

3.6 Validation Design
Form validation is done using a dual-layered approach, combining frontend and backend validation to ensure data integrity and improve security. On the client side, libraries such as Formik and Yup are used to validate required fields, format (e.g., email), minimum character length, and password confirmation before submission. This enhances user experience by offering real-time error feedback and prevents unnecessary server load.

The system checks inputs such as login credentials, legal query forms, and chat messages. On the backend, PHP validation rules are applied to verify inputs using server-side constraints (Welling & Thomson, 2009). These include SQL injection protection, email format checking, and required field enforcement to ensure malicious users cannot bypass the frontend layer.

4. Implementation
This section outlines how the Cyblex system's design was translated into working code using a range of development tools and frameworks. The implementation phase involved setting up the development environment, coding core features, integrating third-party services, and ensuring secure data handling.

4.1 Tools and Environment Setup
The implementation was carried out using a combination of modern development tools and a structured local environment that supported rapid coding, testing, and debugging. The main integrated development environment (IDE) used was Visual Studio Code (VS Code), selected for its lightweight nature, powerful extensions, and native support for both frontend and backend languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python (Microsoft, 2024).

XAMPP was used to configure the local server environment, enabling easy integration of Apache, PHP, and MySQL to replicate a live server setup. This allowed for seamless testing of server-side scripts and database connectivity on a local machine without the need for external hosting during development.

For API testing and simulation, the project implements direct browser-based testing and JavaScript's Fetch API. This approach enables real-time testing of API endpoints (such as login, query submission, and payment processing) directly from the frontend. The project features a comprehensive error logging and response handling system. This method effectively supports debugging of authentication flows and ensures secure data transmission between the client and server, with detailed logging of request details, headers, and responses for troubleshooting purposes.

GitHub was used for version control and collaboration, making it easier to track changes, manage branches, and merge feature updates. It also served as a remote backup during the implementation phase, ensuring source code safety and synchronization.

This toolchain enabled an efficient and agile development workflow that matched the scale and requirements of the Cyblex platform.

4.2 Implementation of Key Features
The Cyblex platform implements several core features to support real-time legal advisory services. These features were designed with distinct access levels for Clients (Users), Legal Advisors, and Administrators. The subsections below outline the major components built, technologies used, challenges faced, and how each feature operates.

4.2.1 User Login and Authentication
Figure 4.2.1.1 shows the login interface. The login module was built using a combination of HTML/CSS for the frontend and PHP for backend authentication. Passwords are securely stored using the bcrypt hashing algorithm to prevent plain-text storage and protect against brute-force attacks (Van Rossum & Drake, 2009).

Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only access features relevant to their roles—client, advisor, or admin (Sommerville, 2016). Once authenticated, the system starts a session and stores a role-specific token with HTTPOnly and Secure cookie settings.

Figure 4.2.1.2 shows the code snippet from login.html used in the frontend form setup.

For full backend logic and code implementation, refer to 8.2 Appendix B

4.2.2 Legal Query Submission Form (User)
Clients may submit legal queries using a structured form, which uses Formik and Yup on the frontend to enforce real-time validations for required fields, proper formatting, and minimum text lengths. This improves the user experience and reduces server burden.

On the backend, the form submission is processed by a PHP script, which performs multiple security and validation checks to protect system integrity and data quality:
Server-side validation:

SQL injection prevention using prepared statements:

Category validation against database values:

Once validated, the query is inserted into the legal_queries table with an initial status of 'pending'. The system then attempts to automatically assign a lawyer based on the query's category and language preference.

For full code implementation, refer to 8.3 Appendix C – Legal Query Submission Code (Frontend and Backend).

4.2.3 Real-Time Advisor Response System (Advisor)
The Cyblex platform implements a real-time messaging system using a combination of WebSocket server and AJAX polling to ensure reliable communication between clients and legal advisors. The system is built using Python for the WebSocket server and PHP/JavaScript for the client-side implementation.

Figure 4.2.3.1 displays the Advisor Response Panel UI, which includes a list of active and pending legal queries, a real-time chat interface for each query, message history with timestamps, query status indicators, and a user information display.

The messaging system is implemented through following components:
WebSocket Server (Python):

Frontend Implementation:

For the complete messaging module, refer to 8.4 Appendix D – Real-Time Advisor Response Code (Python & PHP).

4.2.4 Advisor Verification and Admin Control Panel (Admin)

Figure 4.2.4 shows the admin verification screen, Admins have a secure dashboard built in PHP/Bootstrap, with access to pending advisor applications. Clicking "approve" updates the verification_status field in the database, giving the advisor access to the platform.

RBAC and session-based access control prevent non-admin users from accessing this panel (Sommerville, 2016).

The Advisor Verification and Admin Control Panel functionality is implemented through the following components:
Admin Access Control:

Verification Processing:

Verification List Display

The system implements a secure and efficient workflow for advisor verification, with proper access controls and audit logging. For the full backend implementation and logic, refer to 8.5 Appendix E – Admin Panel and Advisor Verification Module.

4.2.5 Ratings and Feedback System (User)
After a consultation, clients can rate advisors through a feedback form. The score (1–5 stars) and comment are submitted to the Ratings table. The frontend uses conditional logic to allow submission only once per query.

The Ratings and Feedback System functionality is implemented through the following components:
Rating Form Interface

Rating Submission Handler:

Rating Display Component:

Each of these features contributes to Cyblex's reliability and functionality. The use of secure authentication, structured form validation, and role-based access ensures that the platform operates smoothly across its three user types. Modular backend scripts and frontend frameworks allowed for rapid, secure, and scalable development.

For the complete implementation, refer to 8.6 Appendix F – Ratings and Feedback System.

4.3 Code Structure and Organisation
The codebase for the Cyblex platform is organized in a modular and maintainable structure, following a simplified Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This separation of concerns improves readability, testability, and scalability of the application (Sommerville, 2016).

Figure 4.3 illustrates the current directory structure of the project, The project is divided into the following main directories:

4.3.1 Root Directory Files
index.html: Main landing page of the application.
login.html: User login page.
register.html: User registration page.
logout.php: Handles user logout logic.
admin-dashboard.php: Main admin interface.
lawyer-dashboard.php: Interface for lawyers.
client-dashboard.php: Interface for clients.
websocket_server.py: Python script for real-time chat functionality.

4.3.2 Core Directories
/api/: Backend API endpoints.
auth.php, check_auth.php: User authentication endpoints.
submit_query.php, get_query_details.php: Query management endpoints.
send_message.php, get_messages.php: Messaging system endpoints.
register.php, check_user.php: User management endpoints.

Naming conventions follow camelCase for variables and functions, while file names use snake_case for consistency. PHP and Python scripts are grouped by function to promote reusability. Common validation logic, database connections, and response templates are abstracted into shared files for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) compliance.

This organization allows multiple developers to work on different modules concurrently while maintaining a clean, scalable, and easy-to-navigate codebase.

4.4 Challenges and Solutions
The development of the Cyblex platform presented several challenges that required creative and robust solutions. A key challenge was handling API authentication and session management. Due to improper validation and storage of the JWT tokens, which resulted in frequent unauthorized access issues, the original strategy failed. To address this, A strong token-based authentication system with appropriate expiration handling and a refresh token mechanism was implemented. The solution included secure token storage in HTTP-only cookies and proper validation middleware for all API endpoints.

Another significant challenge was managing real-time communication through WebSocket connections. The initial approach failed because of connection stability issues and message synchronization problems between clients. To address this, the implementation was revised to include connection state management, automatic reconnection logic, and message queuing for offline clients. The solution also included proper error handling and logging for debugging connection issues.

A key challenge was dealing with database performance and scalability. The initial approach failed because of inefficient queries and lack of proper indexing, causing slow response times. To address this, the database schema was optimized, appropriate indexes were added, query caching was implemented, and connection pooling was utilized. The solution significantly improved response times and reduced server load.

The hosting environment presented its own set of challenges. The initial approach failed because of resource limitations and configuration issues. To address this, proper error handling was implemented, request rate limiting was added, and file uploads were optimized. The solution included implementing proper caching strategies and optimizing static asset delivery to reduce server load.

A key challenge was ensuring data consistency across different user roles (clients, lawyers, and admins). The initial approach failed because of improper access control and validation. To address this, role-based access control (RBAC) was implemented and comprehensive input validation was added. The solution included proper error handling and user feedback mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

These challenges were overcome through careful planning, proper error handling, and implementation of best practices in web development. The solutions implemented not only fixed the immediate issues but also made the system more robust and maintainable for future development.

5. Testing & Validation

A comprehensive testing approach was adopted to ensure the functionality, reliability, and usability of the Cyblex Real-Time Legal Advisory System. Testing was structured around both functional and non-functional requirements using strategies such as black-box testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Given the system's intended deployment environment, testing was conducted across multiple browsers, devices, and operating systems to ensure cross-platform compatibility and responsive design functionality.

5.1 Overview of Testing Approach

The overall testing approach for this project was designed to ensure that all system components function correctly and meet the specified requirements outlined in Section 2. To verify both functional and non-functional requirements, the following testing methodologies were applied throughout the development lifecycle.

A combination of manual and automated testing techniques were employed in order to validate the system's core functionalities. Black-box testing was primarily used for user interface validation and user workflow testing, while integration testing focused on API endpoints and database connectivity. The testing environment included multiple platforms to ensure comprehensive coverage.

Test environments included:
- Desktop browsers: Chrome (v120+), Firefox (v115+), Edge (v120+)
- Mobile browsers: Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile
- Operating systems: Windows 10/11, macOS, Android, iOS
- Development tools: Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, MySQL Workbench
- API testing: Browser Developer Tools, Postman (for endpoint validation)

The testing process followed an iterative approach, with continuous testing during development phases and comprehensive system testing before deployment. Each module was tested individually before integration testing, ensuring that bugs were identified and resolved early in the development cycle.

5.2 Test Plan and Test Cases

Test cases were designed to validate core modules including user authentication, legal query submission, real-time messaging, advisor verification, and administrative functions. Each test case followed a structured format to ensure repeatability and transparency in the testing process.
